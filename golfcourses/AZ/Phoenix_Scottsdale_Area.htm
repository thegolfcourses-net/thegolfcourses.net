	The Paradise Valley/Phoenix/Scottsdale, Arizona area has a different feel than many of the other parts of the Southwest. There&rsquo;s a freshness that comes from looking at the Superstition Mountains, the large Saguaro cactus, or the open spaces. Over the years it grew up and has become one of the most famous golf destinations in the world.<br>
