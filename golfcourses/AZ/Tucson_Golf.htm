	 Once again we find a state that has conditions ripe for the development of the golf course industry. Like the Phoenix area, Tucson has become a winter destination for golfers who are deprived in the northern climates. The result is a Mecca for &ldquo;snowbirds&rdquo; seeking their fix of sunshine and golf.<br>

Set on the path of an old stagecoach trail developed by Richard Starr, the fifteenth hole has the view those old travelers saw. The magnificent views capture the thrill of the Tucson Mountains and Sonora Desert. It has all been incorporated into a 27-hole facility designed by Arnold Palmer. The three nine hole courses are named the <a href="164-1.htm">Rattler</a>, <a href="164.htm">Coyote</a> and The <a href="164-2.htm">Roadrunner</a>.
