   <h1>Denver Area Golf</h1>
<p>For many years, <a href="http://www.thegolfcourses.net/golfcourses/CO/Denver.htm">Denver</a> has been a beautiful area to
live and work in. There was a huge housing boom that has slowed considerably.
Few have recognized it as a golfing destination, but golf courses abound with
breathtaking views that have made the area famous. The altitude will help with
your golfing enjoyment!!!! You may feel the exhilaration of being a long ball
hitter for the first time in your life! Remember to try out your new power on
the driving range first! You may overestimate what you can do!</p>

<p>
One of the most unique courses in the Denver area is actually in Golden. The <a
href="http://www.thegolfcourses.net/golfcourses/CO/9191.htm">Applewood Golf
Course</a> was built in 1961 for the Adolph Coors Co. Brewery. It is unique in
the eco-friendly care it is given. Since it is on top of the aquifer used by
the company, the company has required the course to go without the use of
dangerous chemicals since 1988. This means the course uses natural fertilizers
and pest controls to produce a highly desirable golf course. Although it has
bluegrass fairways and bent-grass greens, it looks much like any other course.
The result is possible because of the staff's personal care. Greens are
hand-watered, and the grass is watched closely to handle any problems before they
spread. The trade-off is more cost effective than with the use of chemicals.
This is evident in the price of less than $30 for a wonderful golf course.
The course is a par 71, with a length of 6300 yards. J. Press Maxwell designed
the course. Although it has only moderate elevation changes, it offers a
target- orientated course that challenges your strategic thinking. Because of
its location there are many water hazards and a great deal of wildlife. The
result is a course that will be a pleasure to play.
