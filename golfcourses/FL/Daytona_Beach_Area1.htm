<p align="left">The LPGA headquarters is located in Daytona Beach, Florida and the lady professionals have their own course, <a href="14491.htm">LPGA International</a>, that <a href="http://www.golffacility.com/search.asp?OID=388&AID=610&FID=2205">you can play and book your tee time online here</a>. Since 1989 their goal has to develop a facility to improve the women&rsquo;s presence in the field of golf. Two tournaments are held yearly- one in Spring and the other at the end of the LPGA Q-school qualifier. The facility has two courses&mdash;<a href="14491-1.htm">The Legends</a> and <a href="14491.htm">The Champions</a> Courses. Each has been designed to complement the other. <a href="14491.htm">The Champions Course</a>, which opened in 1994, was designed by Rees Jones to be especially suited to the woman&rsquo;s game. It plays from 5 tees a distance of from 5131-yards to 7088-yards. The design features rolling terrain, large greens, and few trees set in a Scottish-links style course. Golf Magazine has listed it as one of the &ldquo;Top Ten You Can Play&rdquo; courses. It has natural marsh features, which add to the beauty of the course. <a href="14491-1.htm">The Legends Course</a> is a 6984-yard, par-72, Arthur Hill design created to challenge every skill needed to become a golf legend. It challenges your shot management of tight tree-lined fairways, statically placed bunkers, water hazards, and fast greens.</p>
<p>Golf Digest rated the <a href="517930.htm">DeBary Golf and Country Club</a> 4 stars in 2004-2005. The 6776-yard, par-72 course is located Northeast of Orlando in <a href="Debary.htm">Debary</a>, next to <a href="Deltona.htm">Deltona</a>, Florida. Lloyd Clifton designed the course with only one water hazard, but plenty of undulation in the fairways and true greens. There are trees lining and buffering the fairways with plenty of wildlife found. The result is a course reminiscent of a course more often found in the Carolinas. It has been designated a bird sanctuary by the National Audubon Society.</p>
<p>The <a href="294.htm">Glen Abbey Golf Club</a> is also located in Debary. Designed by Dominic Palomba Jr., the 6661-yard, par-72 opened in 1975.</p>
<p>Bill Amick originally designed <a href="583820.htm">Hidden Lakes Golf Club</a>, which opened in 1974. Then, in 1995, Lloyd Clifton redesigned the course. Located in New Smyrna Beach, it is a 5400-yard, par-68 course with beautiful views of Turnbull Bay. It is one of the few courses where you are encouraged to walk and enjoy the natural habitat. It has a country club feel in all areas including practice area, clubhouse and swimming pool..</p>
<p><a href="922095.htm">Magnolia Plantation Golf Course</a> is a 7175-yard, par-72 course designed by Dave Harmon located in Lake Mary, Florida. The pristine Wekiva River as a setting of the magnificent layout. Using the forest and natural habitat, the course is home to a variety of wildlife, while at the same time offering enjoyment for all skill levels. You will find it offers wide fairways, undulating greens with an abundance of trees and water hazards, plus deep ravines to challenge your shot-making skills.</p>
<p>The <a href="359040.htm">River Bend Golf Course</a> is located in Ormond Beach, Florida. Lloyd Clifton designed the 6821-yard, par-72 course located beside the Tomoka River. The Tomoka River is a Manatee sanctuary so the area is one of the most guarded areas of Florida. The result is a picturesque course teeming with wildlife. The course itself is somewhat narrow with trees located close in. Each green has its own personality with undulations, and bunkers or mounds complicating each shot. At 616-yards, the 8th hole is the longest par-5 in the area.</p>
<p>The <a href="434.htm">Timacuan Golf Club</a> is located in Lake Mary, Florida. The Ron Garl designed and Bobby Weed remodeled course is considered one of the 20 top courses in Florida. The 6915-yard, par-71 course features rolling fairways running through wetlands and moss-draped trees.</p>
