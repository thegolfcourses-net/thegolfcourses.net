<p align="left">The Orlando area is best known for Disney World, but not for the golfer! He&rsquo;s got a &ldquo;Golf World &ldquo; to tackle. The conditions are near perfect all year around for golfing, although it gets a bit humid in the summer in some places in <a href="Florida.htm">Florida</a>. The temperatures, climate and terrain have formed a natural location for courses to be developed. Therefore, the developers have &ldquo;swamped&rdquo; the state with good courses for the golfer&rsquo;s pleasure. The whole area around the <a href="http://www.golffacility.com/search.asp?OID=388&AID=609">Orlando attractions</a> has a glut of good courses. Check out the information and compare before you commit to only one course! If you&rsquo;re on a budget you will find one to suit your needs. </p>
<p align="left"><a href="16063.htm">The Celebration Golf Club</a> has been named one of Golf Digest&rsquo; Best Places to Play for the 2006-2007 season. It is a 6792-yard, par-72 course with 5 tee boxes. It can be difficult depending on your lie, because the rolling terrain has many mounds and bunkering throughout. If the traps don&rsquo;t get you the water or swales might, so concentrate on your shots, and club selections! Also, be careful because of some of the subtle undulations on some greens! We offer substantial savings on this course so check our <a href="http://www.golffacility.com/search.asp?OID=388&AID=609">tee times page</a>.<br>
  <a href="16063.htm">Celebration Golf Club</a> is located in the <a href="Celebration.htm">Celebration</a>/<a href="Kissimmee.htm">Kissimmee</a> area. The course designers, Robert Trent Jones Sr., and his son Robert Trent Jones Jr. are the most famous in golf history. They created the course from unspoiled natural wetlands to provide an intensely challenging golf for the most experienced golfer. Like all Robert Trent Jones&rsquo; courses this course possesses strategically placed bunkers, rolling terrain and fast greens. The extra tees boxes help make it an enjoyable experience for all for many levels.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="13102.htm">Diamondback Golf Club</a> is located not far from the major Orlando family attractions. Joe Lee designed the course. The 6903-yard, par-72 course is set up so that nearly every club might need to be used. The course&rsquo;s terrain cuts through wetlands and sandy rolling hills so prepare for a very enjoyable, yet demanding game with many water hazards and fast undulating greens.</p>
<p align="left">Golfweek Magazine has rated <a href="238830.htm">The Grande Pines Golf Club</a> as one of the top 100 of &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Best Resort Courses&rdquo;. Marriot&rsquo;s Grande Vista Resort is near by. The Course is part of the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program for American Golf Courses. It has rolling fairways, strategically placed bunkers and multi-tiered greens. With 4 tee boxes you are sure to be able to have a game to call upon your best play.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="1633.htm">Hawk&rsquo;s Landing Golf Club</a> is situated on 220 acres. Designed by Robert Cupp III, it was created to showcase native Florida wildlife and tropical vegetation. It is a manicured course with tall palms, azalea bushes, magnolias and sweet jasmine all blended to please your senses.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="030825.htm">Highlands Reserve Golf Club</a> is much different from most Orlando courses. Devoid of the lush vegetation it focuses on following the nature terrain of Green Swamp Ridge. This is a natural formation of sand that rises on the edge of a beach. The course is 6,673 yards long and goes down 120 feet from the height at the first tee. You are allowed to walk, so it&rsquo;s a natural saunter down the hill. The sand bunkers are natural with the greens and fairways added in such a way to conserve irrigation. It is an experience to know that the sand bunkers are 90 feet deep, but a test of your game to get out of. The views are different than most courses but sure to please any golfer.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="806820.htm">Kissimmee Oaks Golf Club</a> is sure to pleasure the golfer who likes the mature tree-lined course. There are moss-covered old oaks from which the course gets its name, but there is much more. You are in the midst of nature and sure to catch a glimpse of any number of eagles, osprey, beavers or turtles on the 135acre course. It is set up to provide challenges for any level of golfer.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="18110.htm">Orange County National</a> occasionally offers discount tee times. It is a 45-hole facility with two championship courses- The <a href="18110-1.htm">Panther Lake</a> and <a href="18110.htm">Crooked Cat</a> Courses, and a 9-hole course called the <a href="18110-2.htm">Tooth Short Course</a>. Both are PGA Q-School locations with distances of 7350-yards and 7493-yards respectively. The facility has been given 4 &frac12; stars from Golf Digest for 1999-2007 as one of &ldquo;Best Places to play&rdquo;. The courses offer multiple tee placements with rolling terrain, strategically placed bunkers, and large contour greens. <a href="18110.htm">Crooked Cat</a> is more of a links course with fewer trees than the <a href="18110-1.htm">Panther Lake</a> Course, but both offer an incredible game of golf. The <a href="18110-2.htm">Tooth Short Course</a> has been set up with slighter elevation changes, challenging bunker shots and greens. Many people consider the short course when on a tight time schedule or are trying to practice up for the longer courses.<br>

There are tight greens and fairways that remind one of the old Scottish courses. It has been called &ldquo;one of the top 5 most underrated courses in Orlando&rdquo;. You will find sod bunkers, wood-faced bunkers, stone fences and on the #8 hole a red British phone to call in a deli order to pick up on the turn. It can be great fun!</p>
<p align="left"><a href="38201.htm">Stonegate Golf Club</a> has two courses. <a href="38201.htm">The Cypress</a> and <a href="38201-1.htm">The Oakes</a> Courses contain non-linear holes with sloped fairways and large greens.
