<p align="left">When people think Orlando, they think of Disney World. The truth is Orlando is so much more in terms of golf&mdash;there is a glut of good golf courses so the price is reasonable. It is a spacious area where a golfer can golf for a fraction of what would be paid in the tourist season or in most other vacation locations. The tourist can be busy golfing their time away on a budget! I&rsquo;ve found that it not that pricey to stay in the Orlando area, and golf can be cheaper than in most of our home courses. Check out our prices and you will be seduced into coming for a golf vacation!!! The information sure surprised me!! Check out all our Orlando courses to see what is near you.</p>
<p> The<a href="183820.htm"> Errol Estate Country Club</a> is in what some consider &quot;downtown Orlando&quot;. The area is far from being a city like New York City. Instead it has many beautiful pockets of natural beauty. The Errol Estates Country Club is a Joe Lee-designed, 27-Hole golf club that opened in 1973. It consists of 3 courses- <a href="183820-2.htm">The Lake</a>, <a href="183820.htm">Grove</a> and <a href="183820-1.htm">Highland</a> Courses. <a href="183820-2.htm">The Lake Course</a> features wide, rolling fairways with multiple strategically placed bunkers to add challenge to the course. <a href="183820.htm">The Grove Course</a> is more difficult. The rolling terrain is broken up by trees and complicated by marshland, and narrow fairways. <a href="183820-1.htm">The Highland Course</a> has a setting compared to a being on a scenic pathway.</p>
<p><a href="674.htm">Lake Orlando Golf Club</a> is a Lloyd Clifton course set in the thicket of a cypress grove. The four tees lead to shots down narrow fairways and across many water hazards. The result is a tough, challenging course that is sure to test all your playing skills. It is 6803-yards long with a par-72. Recently renovations were done on the course and the clubhouse and are under new ownership.</p>
<p>The <a href="650150.htm">Stoneybrook East Golf Course</a> is another Clifton, Ezell, and Clifton designed property. The design is considered the &ldquo;Old Florida&rdquo; style with wide fairways and large target bunkers and large undulating greens. It has been designed with the use of every club in play. There are areas where wetlands and waterways and clumps of trees come into play. It measures 6820-yards, par 72 from the back tee. With 4 tee boxes you are sure to find one to suit your game.</p>
<p><a href="951.htm">Zellwood Station Golf Course</a> is a 6473-yard, par-72 course located in central Florida in the Orlando area. It features wide fairways and greens with multiple types of hazards placed to challenge your game.</p>
<p>The feature that surprises most people is that golf on many courses is cheap, except perhaps in busy high seasons around Jan.-Feb! It is basically a golfer&rsquo;s market. There are so many courses everywhere that each course does all it can to get your money.</p>
