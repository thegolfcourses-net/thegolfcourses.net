            <p>Atlanta has grown into a hub of golf for that part of the country. Long known for being a beautiful city, that beauty has provided the location for many truly memorable courses. When you want to golf close to the airport, the <a href="8887.htm">Alfred Tup Holmes Course</a> is located 10 minutes away. It was the site of an old battlefield and transformed into a golf course. Named after the man who desegregated Atlanta golf courses in the 1950’s, it has many rolling hills and varying elevations. </p>
