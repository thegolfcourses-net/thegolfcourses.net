        <td>The largest of Hawaii's islands is the Big Island, which has many golf courses that will amaze each golfer who goes there for the tropical golf experience. Hawaii is perhaps our most deeply beautiful state. With the depth of color added to the indescribable variety of vegetation and breath-taking views, a growth of golf here was natural. The joy of being on the golf courses can hardly be put into words. It is beyond words to the point of being beyond emotions. It takes the sport to the next level. Many of these golf experiences can be booked at discount prices on our website.<br>

<p><a href="11896.htm">Kona Country Club</a> contains two courses- the <a href="11896-1.htm">Ocean Course</a> and the <a href="11896.htm">Mountain Course</a>. The Ocean Course is well recognized as being among the top 100 golf courses by Golf Digest. ESPN, Zagat guide ranks it as one of the country&rsquo;s top golf facilities, and players have consistently given it an excellent rating. Once you view the course you will see why. William Bell designed the Ocean Course. It opened in 1966 to showcase the spectacular ocean views available to the property. He also set out to show the natural surroundings. A golfer can see the &ldquo;puka&rdquo; or blowhole on hole #13, or the ancient lava flows, or, perhaps, a view of the Humpback whales from November through March. The physical course consists in wide fairways, Bermuda greens and many sand traps. It is the setting that takes it to the next level! The Mountain Course was given 4 stars by Golf Digest. It offers many elevation changes, 3 lakes and spectacular views of the coast below! William Bell designed the front nine in 1985, and the back nine was added later. Both Courses are par- 72. The Mountain Course has a length of 6634 yards while the Ocean Course is 6748 yards long. </p>
<p><a href="986.htm">Makalei Golf Club</a> is &ldquo;called the course where the locals play&rdquo;. Do not let that lead you to believe it is anything less than a wonderful course! Views of the Ocean are everywhere! Dick Nugent, who has designed many fine courses on the mainland, designed the course. He has incorporated the natural beauty of vegetation, lava cones and cinder cones. The championship course offers multiple tees with a distance of 5242 yards to 7091 yards. Views of the Haleakala Mountain across the channel on hole #15 help make this a must play for your trip to Hawaii! </p>
<p><a href="11898.htm">Waikoloa Beach Resort</a> offers two courses - the <a href="11898.htm">Beach</a> and the <a href="11898-1.htm">Kings'</a> on Kohala Coast of Big Island. The Beach course is a classic Robert Trent Jones Jr. design that follows the Anaeho&rsquo;omalu Bay lava flows. The spectacular views are highlighted by the 502-yard hole #5 which has the most magnificent views of the beach and ocean. It is a par-70 with 6566 yards and a slope of 134. Tom Weiskopf and Jay Morrish designed the Kings&rsquo; Course. It is a Scottish links design offers views of volcanoes framed by tropical foliage. The 7074 yard, par 72, slope 135 course offers wide fairways and pot bunkers set in the midst of ancient lava flows.</p>
<p><a href="2932.htm">Waikoloa Village Golf Course</a> is another course designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr. The 6791-yard par-72 course offers the blending of the natural surroundings with all the features one expects of a Robert Trent Jones Jr. course. It is challenging but set up to offer all players an enjoyable game of golf.</p>
<p><a href="14288.htm">Waimea Country Club</a> is built on pasturelands with wide-open country all around. It is a links design that abounds with wildlife and offering a chance to enjoy the grandeur of the ranching heritage and open spaces found in Hawaii. </p>
