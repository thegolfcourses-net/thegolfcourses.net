<p>The Maui elleair Daio Group, the third largest paper manufacturer in Japan, owns the <a href="1000.htm">Maui Elleair Golf Club</a> and other companies around the world. &ldquo;Elleair&rdquo; is a word that means &ldquo;fairy of the wind&rdquo; or soft and supple in Japan. The course opened in 1987 and is currently being remodeled to make it user-friendlier. They are widening the fairways and offering many state of the art features to their carts.</p>
<p><a href="1002.htm">Kaanapali Golf Course</a> is a complete Golf resort that has established a tradition as one of the finest destinations in Hawaii. It is made up of two spectacular Courses- The <a href="1002-1.htm">Royal</a> or North Course, and the <a href="1002.htm">Kai</a> or South Course. The Royal Course is one of two Robert Trent Jones Sr. courses in Hawaii. It opened in 1962 and set the bar for Hawaiian courses that use the natural terrain. It winds up the mountain from the indescribable shoreline towards the West Maui Mountain foothills and showcases each feature available. It is a dream come true for the golfer! Large undulating greens top off the magnificent holes. The course is 6700-yards with a par 71, and is designed to challenge your club selection and hitting skills. The Kai Course began as an Executive Course. In 1976 Arthur Jack Snyder redesigned it into a 6400-yard, par 70 course to be enjoyed by the more casual golfer. Robin Nelson has recently renovated it. Both courses were developed on an old sugar cane plantation. The Sugar Cane Train goes past several of the holes taking tourists past many local historical spots.</p>
<p><a href="218140.htm">Kahili Golf Course</a> is actually the King Kamehameha Golf Club located in the West Maui Mountains. It was named after the historical figure that combined the islands into a single kingdom and is considered the greatest Hawaiian King. Ted Robinson Sr. designed the course in 1991. Ted Robinson Jr. refreshed it in 2005. The clubhouse is an expanded version of plans submitted for a home in Fort Worth by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1949. The goal of the facility is to honor the traditional art and culture of Hawaii.</p>
<p><a href="38106.htm">The Dunes at Maui Lani Golf Club</a> a newer course that has received numerous awards. It opened in 1999.It is located in an area known as the Kahului Isthmus located between two mountain ranges created by volcanoes. The dunes are much like in Scotland&rsquo;s links courses. There are four tee locations with a maximum distance of 6841 yards. It has wide undulating fairways and fast greens.</p>
<p>The <a href="218140.htm">Wailea Golf Resort</a> hosts the Wendy&rsquo;s Championship Skins Game, a popular Champions Tour event. The Resort is a full service resort offering many services- three golf courses, lit practice area and complete golf instruction. The resort is among the most highly acclaimed golf course in the country. The three courses are the <a href="961920-2.htm">Gold</a>, the <a href="961920-1.htm">Emerald</a> and <a href="961920.htm">Blue</a>. The Gold is the location of the Skins game and is considered the most difficult of the three. Robert Trent Jones Jr. designed the course and sought to preserve the natural integrity of the ancient lava walls. In recognition of his feat the Maui Historical Society recognized him. The 7078-yard course features magnificent views of the Ocean, Molokini islet, lava walls and sparkling white sand. What could be a more fantastic golf experience! The Emerald course runs 6825 yards. It has a much gentler format. The rolling fairways are wider and offer a more forgiving game. There are 4 to 6 tee boxes making it suitable to the more relaxed golfer. There are the same many wonderful scenic views. Arthur Jack Snyder designed the Blue course. With a distance of 6765-yards it is a combination of the two other courses. There are wider fairways, but more complicated bunker placements allowing for a more challenging game of golf. All the courses give you a full enjoyment of the Island charms.</p>
