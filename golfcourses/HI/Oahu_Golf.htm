	 The Hawaiian Islands are without a doubt, the most desirable area for golf in the United States. The exotic natural beauty of the Pacific Ocean,  volcanic mountains, and lush greenery makes Hawaii a golf  destination unlike no other. The largest Island is the Big Island, which has many golf courses that will amaze each golfer who goes there for the tropical golf experience. But Oahu is the destination which comes to mind first and foremost due to easy traveling into and out of Honolulu and the astounding golf courses nearby. <br>

<p>The <a href="36304.htm">Coral Creek Golf Course</a> is located on Ewa Beach. It is a Robin Nelson and Haworth design that uses spring fed lakes and coral creeks to provide water features on 13 holes. It is a 6808-yard, par-72 course that has been recognized by Golf Digest in 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2006 as one of the &ldquo;Best Places to Play&rdquo; golf. There are four tee boxes, and long rolling fairways, elevated greens and an abundance of outcropped cliffs to challenge your game.</p>
<p><a href="445930.htm">Ko Olina Golf Club</a> is part of Ko Olina Resort and Marina, a Marriott property. Ted Robinson designed this 6867-yards. The design is highly recognized as one of the &ldquo;Top 75 Golf Resorts&rdquo; in the country by Golf Digest. It is to be the location of the 2006 and 2007 LPGA Fields Open. The course contains multiple tee locations that hit into large landing areas to create an exciting experience. Accompany this with multi-tiered greens and strategically placed water features and you&rsquo;ve got a game hard to pass up!!! Team this with state of the art carts and you&rsquo;re good to go to the next level in golf!!!</p>
<p>I consider this course a bargain when you team the quality of the <a href="1032.htm">Ko&rsquo;olau Golf Course</a> with the prices offered of our tee times page. It really is one of the best courses in Oahu!!! Opening in 1992, this course was designed by Dick Nugent to sit at the base of the Ko&rsquo;olau Ridge Mountains. It is a 7310-yard, par-72 course from the championship tees. Add to that a slope of 152 and you have a killer of a course!!!! Of course for the rest of us there are 3 more tees to choose from, and an experience to take home with you for a lifetime!!! Many elevation and temperature changes take place as you play the course and make it considered the toughest in the country. Deep ravines, large sand bunkers, and fast greens are some of the features that make this a must play on Oahu Island.</p>
<p><a href="1765.htm">Luana Golf and Country Club</a> contains a Pete Dye designed course. Since opening in 1994, it has been a destination for many golfers. Although it is only 6595-yards long it was set up to challenge golfers of all strengths. It features large elevation changes. deep ravines, winding streams, and undulating greens. Each feature is set up to challenge your golfing skills. Carved out of tropical forests, the wildlife and vegetation seen are everything a Hawaiian vacation could wish for! </p>
<p>The <a href="1037.htm">Olomana Golf Links</a> course opened in 1967. It is an 18-hole course 6326-yards in length. Bob Baldock designed the par-72 course which offers a links design. The front 9 have wide fairways and many water hazards, while the rolling fairways of the back 9 are dotted with massive sand bunkers. The course is somewhat easier than other courses and sometimes offers rates for seniors for about $40.</p>
<p><a href="1026.htm">Turtle Bay Resort and Spa</a> offers two-championship courses- the <a href="1026-1.htm">Arnold Palmer Course</a> and the <a href="1026.htm">George Fazio Course</a>. Each represents the distinct personality of its designer. The Arnold Palmer Course is on the Champions Tour, featuring the Turtle Bay Championship through 2008. It has 5 or 6 tee boxes and a maximum length of 7218-yards so it can offer a challenge to all skill levels. Located near Punaho&rsquo;olapa Marsh, a 100-acre wildlife sanctuary, the viewing of wildlife is spectacular. The front nine is reminiscent of the Scottish links, while the back wanders through an ironwood forest and borders the bird sanctuary. The Fazio course was designed with wide fairways, deep bunkers and fast undulating greens. These are both popular so only occasionally offer discount rates. </p>
