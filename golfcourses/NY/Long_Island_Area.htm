<font size=+4 color ="#004E00"><strong>Long Island!</strong></font><br>


<p align="left"> Many fine golf courses exist on Long Island where teetimes can be booked at greatly discounted prices. Whether near the New York City <a href="Queens.htm">Queens</a> border to the east, or all the way out to the end of the island near <a href="Montauk.htm">Montauk</a>, please take the time to look over the following offerings.
<br>
<a href="37620.htm">Tallgrass Golf Course</a>, at <a href="Shoreham.htm">Shoreham</a>, NY, near Long Island Sound, is a great place to enjoy 18 holes of Scottish links-style golf, complete with pot bunkers and all. Built in 1999 and designed by Gil Hanse, Tallgrass measures just over 6,500 yards from the back tees and has wide open fairways.  Tallgrass is named after the tall fescue grass that catches the errant golfers' balls all too often and gives fits and frustrations to them while trying to score low.  However, the course keeps them coming back, partially due to the wonderful club house amenities, including bar, full restaurant, and locker rooms.<br>
 <br>

About in the very middle of Long Island, play a round of golf at <a href="997040.htm">Hamlet Wind Watch Golf Course</a>, a parkland-style course with tree-lined fairways.  Located in <a href="Hauppauge.htm">Hauppauge</a>, NY, this 18 hole facility can sometimes get very windy, as its name implies, adding to the difficulty already present because of rolling hills, numerous sand traps and a lot of water hazards.  A resort hotel is nearby, yet the course is open to the public.  At par of 71, the total length from the back tees is approximately 6,600 yards. 

<br>

Another great choice near the Northern shore of Long Island, in <a href="WadingRiver.htm">Wading River</a>, NY, is <a href="37871.htm">Great Rock Golf Club</a>, a shorter 18 hole facility, only 6,193 yards from the tips.  Also with trees lining the fairways and rolling hills, Great Rock, designed by Buddy Johnson and opening in 2001 has only 2 water holes. Flat, but fast greens are featured on most holes. 


<br>
In that same area as Long Island sits <a href="382430.htm">Heatherwood Golf Club</a>, another 18-hole public course. 
 This little executive-style layout, is located in <a href="Centereach.htm">Centereach</a>, NY.  A lake comes into play on a couple of the holes.
